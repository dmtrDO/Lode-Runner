Go through several levels (level1.txt, level2.txt...),
this will help you understand the basic concept.

You can also go to save.txt to change the level from which the
game starts, there should be only one number and nothing else, 
the number itself should be in the range from 1 to n, where n is
the number of levels in the game “level{n}.txt”.

If after adding or changing a file the game gives an error,
it means that you made a mistake when adding or changing a level/save file,
in this case you need to either return the file to the previous state or 
delete the file, if you do not remember how the file looked before, 
then go to https://github.com/dmtrDO/Lode-Runner and follow 
the instructions in the README file and download the file you need.
